Calculus is a branch of mathematics focused on rates of change (differential calculus) and accumulation of quantities (integral calculus). It serves as the foundation for many scientific and engineering disciplines. The concept of a limit is fundamental to calculus. It describes the value a function approaches as the input gets closer to a specific point. For example, 
lim
⁡
𝑥
→
2
(
3
𝑥
+
1
)
=
7
lim 
x→2
​
 (3x+1)=7, meaning as 
𝑥
x approaches 2, the function 
3
𝑥
+
1
3x+1 gets arbitrarily close to 7. The derivative measures the rate at which a function changes with respect to its variable. It is defined as 
𝑓
′
(
𝑥
)
=
lim
⁡
ℎ
→
0
𝑓
(
𝑥
+
ℎ
)
−
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
ℎ
f 
′
 (x)=lim 
h→0
​
  
h
f(x+h)−f(x)
​
 . For instance, given 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
2
f(x)=x 
2
 , the derivative is 
𝑓
′
(
𝑥
)
=
2
𝑥
f 
′
 (x)=2x, found by applying the definition. Integrals, on the other hand, are used to calculate the accumulation of quantities, such as areas under curves or total distances. A definite integral is represented as 
∫
𝑎
𝑏
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
 
𝑑
𝑥
∫ 
a
b
​
 f(x)dx, which calculates the area under the curve 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
f(x) from 
𝑥
=

x=a to

=

x=b. For example, evaluating 
∫

(
